    <p>A little bit more about me</p>

    <p>
      After finishing high school in 2016, I clearly had an inclination for logical sciences, so I
      decided to study Physics at University of Barcelona. That didn‚Äôt turn out very well, and I
      decided to take a break from the degree, in which I took a gap year to Costa Rica üá®üá∑

    </div>

    <p>
      This experience was definitely life changing. I ended up staying for much longer, and lived in
      other countries like Mexico and Panama, worked in hostels and hotels doing various hospitality
      roles, which I combined with web development work. (Check out my
      <a href="https://github.com/nightrunner4" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to see some of that).

    <p>
      At some point during these travels, I met a South African in Costa Rica that was a yachtie. He
      told me about the industry and his job, which was totally new to me at the time, and I
      remember thinking to myself: This seems pretty cool. Since then, the idea stayed in the back
      of my mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      Somewhere around October this year I finally decided to make the jump, and If I was gonna do
      it, I wasn‚Äôt gonna half-ass it, so I embarked on a sailing trip using the fincrew platform,
      and moved to Fort Lauderdale.
    </p>

    <p>
      We sailed in a crew of two (captain and me) from Boston, MA to Norfolk, VA on a 642 nautical
      mile trip. I got a grasp of what being in the ocean is like and learned a lot. I can say I can
      confidently drive a boat now.

    <p>
      I opened an instagram account (<a href="https://instagram.com/amasails/" target="_blank">@amasails</a>) to
      document and share the whole trip, as I knew this was an important experience to showcase to
      possible employers, which I invite you to visit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since I‚Äôve always enjoyed technical related problems and love to learn new information, it was
      clear to me that engineering was the path. I studied AEC1 & 2 at MPT in Fort Lauderdale, one
      of the best marine schools I could find.
    </p>

    <p>
      I surrounded myself with experienced people from the industry, talked to them as much as I
      could and soaked it all up like a sponge. My AEC teacher was John Walsh, a Chief Engineer on
      yachts with over 20 years of experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      John definitely managed to transmit his passion and expertise for engineering, often
      explaining the crazy situations he‚Äôs been through during all his years in yachting and how
      they managed to overcome them. I didn‚Äôt know yachts had such complex and diverse technology. I
      kinda wish the course had been longer as the two weeks went by like a flash and I absolutely
      loved them.
    </p>

    <p>I studied hard and got good grades in both exams.</p>

      <img class='aec2-grade' src="img/aec2-grade.jpg" />
    </div>

    <p>
      And this is where I currently stand. Looking to solidify my experience, get on an actual
      yacht, and make this dream a reality. I'm sharing this because I think that, despite having no
      experience on yachts, sharing my story can showcase my commitment and passion, which can prove
      I‚Äôm valuable. On a long term basis I don‚Äôt rule out the possibility of pursuing the SV
      Engineer Path and working to become Chief. But step by step first!
