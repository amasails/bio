    <h1>AMADEU SERRAS</h1>
    <h2>Junior Engineer 🔧</h2>

    <p>A little bit more about me</p>

    <p>
      After finishing high school, I clearly had an inclination for logical sciences, so I decided
      to study Physics at University of Barcelona. That didn't turn out very well, and I decided to
      take a break from the degree, in which I took a gap year to Costa Rica 🇨🇷
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      The experience was definitely life changing. When I went back, it wasn't the same, so I
      decided I wanted to keep traveling. To sustain the plan, I worked in hospitality roles in
      hotels and hostels, and combined that with software development freelance work (check out my
      <a href="https://github.com/nightrunner4" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to see some of that).

    <p>
      At some point during these travels, I met a South African in Costa Rica that was a yachtie 🛥️.
      He told me about the industry and his job, which was totally new to me at the time, and I
      remember thinking to myself: This seems pretty cool. Since then, the idea stayed in the back
      of my mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      Somewhere around October this year I finally decided to make the jump, and if I was gonna do
      it, I wasn't gonna half-ass it, so I embarked on a sailing trip using the
      <a href="https://www.findacrew.net/crew/416439" target="_blank">findacrew</a> platform, and
      moved to Fort Lauderdale 📍.
    </p>

    <p>
      We sailed in a crew of two (captain and me) from Boston, MA to Norfolk, VA on a 642 nautical
      mile trip. I got a grasp of what being in the ocean is like and learned a lot. I can say I can
      confidently drive a boat now.

    <p>
      I created an instagram account (<a href="https://instagram.com/amasails/" target="_blank"
        >@amasails</a
      >) which I invite you to visit, to document and share the whole trip, as I knew this was an
      important experience to showcase to possible employers. 📷
    </p>

    <p>
      Since I've always enjoyed technical problems and love to learn new information, it was clear
      to me that engineering was the path 🔧. I studied AEC1 & 2 at MPT in Fort Lauderdale, one of
      the best marine schools I could find.
    </p>

    <p>
      I surrounded myself with experienced people from the industry, talked to them as much as I
      could and soaked it all up like a sponge. My AEC teacher was John Walsh, a Chief Engineer on
      yachts with over 20 years of experience. 🧑‍🏭
    </p>

    <p>
      John definitely managed to transmit his passion and expertise for engineering, often
      explaining the crazy situations he's been through during all his years in yachting and how him
      and the crew managed to overcome them. I didn't know yachts had such complex and diverse
      technology. I kinda wish the course had been longer as the two weeks went by like a flash and
      I absolutely loved them. ✏️ I studied hard and got good grades in both exams.

    </div>

    <p>
      And this is where I currently stand. Looking to solidify my experience, get on an actual
      yacht, and make this goal a reality. I'm sharing this because I think that, despite having no
      experience on yachts, sharing my story can showcase my commitment and passion. On a long term
      basis I don't rule out the possibility of pursuing the SV Engineer path and working to become
      Chief. But step by step first!
